### Layout Implementation Options

1. **Flexbox**:
   - Pros: Easy to center elements, flexible layout adjustments, and responsive design.
   - Cons: Might require additional media queries for complex layouts.
   - Recommendation: Use Flexbox for the header, main hero section, and footer for easy alignment and centering.

2. **CSS Grid**:
   - Pros: Excellent for creating complex layouts, precise control over placement.
   - Cons: Can be overkill for simpler layouts, slightly more complex syntax.
   - Recommendation: Use CSS Grid for the "How It Works" section to easily align the three steps side by side.

3. **Absolute/Relative Positioning**:
   - Pros: Precise control over element placement.
   - Cons: Can lead to issues with responsiveness and overlapping elements.
   - Recommendation: Avoid using absolute positioning for major layout elements to ensure responsiveness.
